## Audio Emotion Recognizer (No-Code ML Project)

This project uses Google Teachable Machine to classify emotions from short speech audio clips.
The model predicts three emotion categories:
- Happy
- Angry
- Neutral
It demonstrates the core steps of a machine learning workflow — data collection, labeling, training, evaluation, and model export — all without requiring prior coding experience.

# 🎧 Audio Emotion Recognizer (No-Code ML Project)

This project uses **Google Teachable Machine** to classify emotions from short speech audio clips. The model predicts three emotion categories:

- **Happy**
- **Angry**
- **Neutral**

It is an introductory machine learning project demonstrating data collection, labeling, training, evaluation, and model export without requiring prior coding experience.

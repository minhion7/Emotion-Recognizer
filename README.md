🎧 Audio Emotion Recognizer (No-Code ML Project)

This project uses Google Teachable Machine to classify emotions from short speech audio clips.
The model predicts three emotion categories:

Happy

Angry

Neutral

It demonstrates the core steps of a machine learning workflow — data collection, labeling, training, evaluation, and model export — all without requiring prior coding experience.

🐍 Python Audio Analysis Notebook

This project also includes a small Python notebook
(analysis/audio_features_analysis.ipynb)
that demonstrates how emotion-recognition systems process speech signals using basic audio signal processing.

The notebook performs:

Audio loading and playback

Waveform visualization

Mel spectrogram generation
(the same type of input used by models like Teachable Machine)

Basic audio feature extraction, including:

mean pitch (F0)

RMS energy

spectral centroid

These features are commonly used in machine learning models for
emotion classification, voice analysis, and affective computing.
The notebook helps show the signal-processing steps that occur under the hood of no-code ML tools.
